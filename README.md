# longitudinal_EEG_timescales
This repository contains the data and code used to produce the results published in XXX

Script 1 splits the subjects into two independent cohorts (exploratory and validation)
Script 2 is the pipeline to estimate the intrinsic timescales and exclude outliers. The dataframes created with this script are passed to matlab scripts to calculate the linear mixed models and the correlations with alpha rhythm's features. 

Script 3 ### MATLAB SCRIPTS THAT CREATES THE DATA SHARED IN THE DATA FOLDER
Script 4 ### MATLAB SCRIPT FOR LLM AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS

Script 5 runs the comparisons between infant and adult data, both comaprint the distributions and establishing the linear models.
