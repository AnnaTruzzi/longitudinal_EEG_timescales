## ðŸ§ª How to run analyses / reproduce results

Below is a suggested order. Make sure all dependencies (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`) are installed in your environment.

1. **Convert MATLAB outputs**  
   python 1_data_matlab_to_python.py
   This creates data files in a Python format that downstream scripts will use.

2. **Split participants into random exploratory and validation groups**
    python 2_select_subj_random.py
    Random seed is fixed to ensure reproducibility

2. **Estimate timescales per subject**
    python 3_eeg_intrinsic_timescales_estimation_pipeline.py
    This is the heart of the pipeline: it computes intrinsic timescales, filters out outliers, and creates summary data tables.
    Bespoke functions used in this pipeline are defined in the script tau_estimate.py

    The long format data in output are passed on to Matlab for inputation (see script XXX). Processed timescales data used in further anlaysis are shared in the compressed file /Data/Longitudinal Data.zip. (This files are created with the script 3_tau_data_extraction.R)

3. **Modeling developmental trajectory**
    4_Tau_Development_LMMAnalysis.R 
    Runs mixed models to trace developmental trajectory from 6 to 16 months

4. **Correlation with alpha properties**
    5_Tau_Correlations_AlphaProperties.R 
    Runs associations with alpha rhythm features.
    Datasets for the alpha features are too heavy to be shared on Github, please contact the corresponding author (Dr. Anna Truzzi, a.truzzi@qub.ac.uk) to request them.

5. **Comparison with adults**
    python 4_eeg_ITS_GroupComparisons&LinearModels_pipeline.py
    This takes the precomputed subject-level metrics and runs the comparisons and linear models between infants and adults.


Additional scripts to run control analysis and produce figures are shared in the folder "Additional scripts".


ðŸ“‹ Requirements & environment

Python 3.x (recommended â‰¥ 3.8)

Common packages: numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib / seaborn (for plotting)

(If any MATLAB-to-python conversion uses scipy.io or similar, ensure that is installed)


ðŸ§  Notes

Random seeds are fixed to ensure reproducibility of subject group assignments.

File paths can be updated directly in the scripts if you wish to adapt the workflow for your own data.

All scripts are written to be modular, so you can import specific functions for your own analyses (e.g., from tau_estimate.py).
